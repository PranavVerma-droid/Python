x = 10
y = 10

x += 10 #this is the same as x=x+10
x *=10 #This is the same as x=x*10 etc.

# x == y (Means Equal to)
# x != y (Means not Equal to)
# x > y (Means x is greater than y or y is smaller than x)
# x < y (Means x is smaller than y or y is greater than x)
# x >= y (Means that x is greater then or equal to y)
# x <= y (Means that y is greater than or equal to y)
