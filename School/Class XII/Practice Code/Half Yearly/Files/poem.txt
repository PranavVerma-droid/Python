The River That Remembers

Beneath the whispering canopy of time,
a river winds, silver-throated, patient,
carving valleys not only in stone,
but in memory—
where shadows of the past drift
like fallen leaves refusing to sink.

It begins as all rivers do:
a trickle, a murmur, a half-forgotten spring
hidden in the folds of mountains
that have seen ages erode crowns into dust.
The water glimmers like a promise
no one yet has spoken aloud.

Children once played on its banks,
their laughter woven into reeds,
and the air carried their voices
like fragile kites pulled by invisible threads.
Now, only echoes remain—
a chorus stitched into the current,
rising and fading,
rising and fading.

Along the river walked lovers too,
leaving footprints in damp earth
that the water swallowed slowly,
as if reluctant to erase them.
They whispered vows not to the sky,
nor to each other,
but to the rhythm of flowing water,
as though the river alone
was keeper of all truth.

Seasons draped their robes in turn.
In spring, blossoms scattered like confetti
upon its restless face.
In summer, fireflies danced above it
like wandering souls
seeking mirrors in the waves.
Autumn leaned close,
tinting its surface with molten gold,
while winter froze it into silence,
a glassy archive of every tear
ever shed into its arms.

And the river kept moving.
Always moving.
For that is what rivers know:
the futility of stillness,
the necessity of surrender.

Yet it remembers.
It remembers the hands cupped for thirst,
the oars that cut it like blades,
the prayers cast in folded paper boats.
It remembers the fallen bridges,
the flood that roared like anger,
and the quiet after—
when the moon’s reflection returned,
delicate as forgiveness.

One day, perhaps,
the river will find its end in the sea,
and the sea will ask:
“Tell me, what have you carried?”
And the river will pour out
the dust of centuries,
the laughter of children,
the promises of lovers,
the songs of seasons,
the tears of storms.
The sea will hold it all,
vast and indifferent,
yet shimmering with the light of inheritance.

But until then,
the river winds onward—
past villages that no longer speak its name,
past cities that steal its strength
and forget to give thanks,
past forests where wolves still drink
under starlight too ancient to betray them.

The river remembers,
and so it teaches:
we are not made of stone,
but of water,
and water never forgets.
